# Conclusion of Julienne Walker

# AVL trees are about as close to optimal as balanced binary search trees can
# get without eating up resources. You can rest assured that the O(log N)
# performance of binary search trees is guaranteed with AVL trees, but the extra
# bookkeeping required to maintain an AVL tree can be prohibitive, especially
# if deletions are common. Insertion into an AVL tree only requires one single
# or double rotation, but deletion could perform up to O(log N) rotations, as
# in the example of a worst case AVL (ie. Fibonacci) tree. However, those cases
# are rare, and still very fast.

# AVL trees are best used when degenerate sequences are common, and there is
# little or no locality of reference in nodes. That basically means that
# searches are fairly random. If degenerate sequences are not common, but still
# possible, and searches are random then a less rigid balanced tree such as red
# black trees or Andersson trees are a better solution. If there is a significant
# amount of locality to searches, such as a small cluster of commonly searched
# items, a splay tree is theoretically better than all of the balanced trees
# because of its move-to-front design.

    """
    AVLTree implements a balanced binary tree with a dict-like interface.

    see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree

    In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, and
    it is the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the
    heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one;
    therefore, it is also said to be height-balanced. Lookup, insertion, and
    deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n
    is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and
    deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.

    The AVL tree is named after its two inventors, G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M.
    Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper "An algorithm for the
    organization of information."

    AVLTree() -> new empty tree.
    AVLTree(mapping) -> new tree initialized from a mapping
    AVLTree(seq) -> new tree initialized from seq [(k1, v1), (k2, v2), ... (kn, vn)]
