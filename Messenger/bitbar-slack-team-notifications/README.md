2. Clone this repo to a directory of your choice. You will symlink the executable file afterwards to your bitbar plugins folder

3. Inside the cloned directory, run `npm install`

## Configure
You will need to get your [Slack Legacy Tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) for every team you want to get notifications from. After getting the legacy tokens, add them to the `tokens.js` file:

```
module.exports = [
	'xoxp-123456',
	'xoxp-abcdef'
];
```
